				<h1>WILD GEESE</h1>
				<pre>
You do not have to be good.
You do not have to walk on your knees
for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.
You only have to let the soft animal of your body
love what it loves.
Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.
Meanwhile the world goes on.
Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
are moving across the landscapes,
over the prairies and the deep trees,
the mountains and the rivers.
Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,
are heading home again.
Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,
the world offers itself to your imagination,
calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting -
over and over announcing your place
in the family of things.

<font size="" color="HOTPINK"><p><B><big><I></I>Although light is made up of waves, </big><I></I><B></p>		Planck’s quantum hypothesis tells us that in some ways it behaves 
					as if it were composed of particles: it can be emitted or absorbed 
					only in packets, or quanta. Equally, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle 
					implies that particles behave in some respects like waves: they do not 
					have a definite position but are “smeared out” with a certain probability 
					distribution. The theory of quantum mechanics is based on an entirely new 
					type of mathematics that no longer describes the real world in terms of 
					particles and waves; it is only the observations of the world that may 
					be described in those terms. There is thus a duality between waves and 
					particles in quantum mechanics: for some purposes it is helpful to think 
					of particles as waves and for other purposes it is better to think of waves 
					as particles. An important consequence of this is that one can observe what 
					is called interference between two sets of waves or particles. 
					That is to say, the crests of one set of waves may coincide with the troughs 
					of the other set. The two sets of waves then cancel each other out rather
					than adding up to a stronger wave as one might expect.</font>
